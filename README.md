## üß† Paper Overview

This repository provides the official implementation of the proposed DDIM-based unsupervised anomaly detection framework for hypertension screening from raw PPG signals.  

The model leverages **Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)** to learn the distribution of normal PPG signals, enabling label-free detection of morphological anomalies indicative of hypertension.

Key contributions include:
- A 1D-DDIM framework tailored for physiological signals
- Customized UNet backbone with attention and timestep embeddings
- Reconstruction-error-based thresholding for unsupervised classification
- Evaluation across 3 public datasets: **BP Assessment**, **PPG-BP**, and **PulseDB**

## üìÇ Dataset & Preprocessing

The framework was validated on three public datasets:

- **BP Assessment Dataset**
- **PPG-BP Dataset**
- **PulseDB**

Preprocessing includes:
- Signal normalization
- Fixed-length segmentation (e.g., 2100 samples @1kHz)
- Subject-wise training/testing split (no overlap)
- Optional filtering (e.g., HR range, SNR)

## üß± Model Architecture

The model follows a UNet-based DDIM pipeline:

- **Forward Process**: Gaussian noise added over time steps  
- **Reverse Process**: Deterministic DDIM sampling with learned denoiser  
- **Backbone**: 1D UNet with Timestep Embedding, Cross-Attention, and Residual Blocks  
- **Loss**: Weighted combination of L1 + Spectral + Smoothness losses

Threshold $\tau$ is selected based on reconstruction error distribution of normal validation samples.
